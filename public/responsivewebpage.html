		<p>he Great Chicago Fire was a conflagration that burned from Sunday, October 8, to early Tuesday, October 10, 1871. 
		The fire killed up to 300 people, destroyed roughly 3.3 square miles of Chicago, Illinois, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless.
		Though the fire was one of the largest U.S. disasters of the 19th century, and destroyed much of the city's central business district, 
		Chicago was rebuilt and continued to grow as one of the most populous and economically important American cities.
		The very night the fire broke out, an even deadlier fire annihilated Peshtigo,Wisconsin and other villages and towns north of the city Green Bay.</p></div>

	<p>In 1871, the Chicago Fire Department had 185 firefighters with just 17 horse-drawn steam engines to protect the entire city.
		The initial response by the fire department was quick, but due to an error by the watchman, Matthias Schaffer, 
		the firefighters were sent to the wrong place, allowing the fire to grow unchecked.
		An alarm sent from the area near the fire also failed to register at the courthouse where the fire watchmen were. 
		Also, the firefighters were tired from having fought numerous small fires and one large fire in the week before.
		These factors combined to turn a small barn fire into a conflagration.</p></div>

		<p>Chicago had a weakness for “big things,” and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. 
		It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. 
		Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation."
		Olmsted also believes that with brick walls and disciplined firemen and police<p></div>

	<div class="main2div1div1"><p>Land speculators, such as Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard, and business owners quickly set about rebuilding the city. 
	The first load of lumber for rebuilding was delivered the day the last burning building was extinguished. 
	By the World's Columbian Exposition 22 years later, Chicago hosted more than 21 million visitors. 
	The Palmer House hotel burned to the ground in the fire 13 days after its grand opening. 
	Its developer Potter Palmer secured a loan and rebuilt the hotel to higher standards across the street from the original, 
	proclaiming it to be "The World's First Fireproof Building".Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure,including its transportation systems, remained intact.
	Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth,
	as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers. At the time of the fire,
	Chicago’s population was approximately 324,000;within nine years,there were some 500,000 Chicagoans. 
	By 1890, the city was a major economic and transportation hub with an estimated population of more than 1 million people. 
	(In America, only New York City had a larger population at the time.) 
	In 1893, Chicago hosted the World’s Columbian Exposition,a tourist attraction visited by some 27.5 million people.</p>
